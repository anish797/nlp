Unusual Network Activity Detected: Investigation Ongoing

Our SIEM has detected anomalous behavior across several workstations with the following characteristics:

Observations:
- Unusual late-night login patterns (2:00 AM - 4:00 AM local time)
- Spike in data transfers to cloud storage providers
- Multiple failed attempts to access restricted HR databases
- No known malware signatures detected

Possible Explanations:
- Misconfigured automated backup jobs
- Insider threat scenario
- Compromised service accounts

Next Steps:
- Isolate suspicious endpoints for forensic analysis
- Review recent changes to IAM policies
- Conduct user awareness interviews
- Enhance endpoint monitoring rules
